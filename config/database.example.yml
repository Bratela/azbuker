# WARNING: Postgres cluster is supposed to be in UTF8 with ru_RU.UTF-8 locale (template1 DB).
# This is required for fulltext search to work properly.
# If your PG cluster is not, you may

#     2) Add TEMPLATE=template0 option when creating new DB for azbuker (this way only Azbuker databases will be in ru_RU.UTF-8 locale)
